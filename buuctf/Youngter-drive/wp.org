* process
it is a windows multi-thread program.
the first thread get the mutex first and the second thread is waiting now, then the second one get the mutex and the first one is waiting.
so the half of input is executed on the first thread, the other half on the second one, i guess.
but i'm in doubt that why the second thread wouldn't be executed first.
by the way, the decoded output is lack of the last character, in the real match, it doesn't matter, but in this platform(buuctf), it should be 'E'.
