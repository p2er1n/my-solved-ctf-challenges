* process
when the program runs, it will fill up some memory area which will be used in this program.
so, we should dynamically debug it and dump the filled data.
this program reads our input and use the data encrypted and then caculates its sha1 to compare with desired value.
the input should be 48 chars, because the input should only includes printable ascii characters, so there will be n^48 possible inputs.
if we brute it, it should have been impossible to get the flag, but author tells that the flag is a meaningful string, so maybe it occurs at a early stage.
more detail is in my exp.py file.
btw, i spent about 1m30s to get the correct flag in my machine.
